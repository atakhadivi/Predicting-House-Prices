# Predicting-House-Prices

# Goal

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the prices of houses based on various features such as location, number of rooms, size of the property, etc.

# Steps

Data Collection: Collect data on houses for sale in your area. You can use websites like Zillow or Redfin to gather this data.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data. This may involve removing missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical variables, and scaling the data.

Feature Selection: Identify the most important features that affect the price of a house. This may involve using techniques such as correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), or feature importance from decision trees.

Model Selection: Choose the appropriate machine learning technique to build your model. You can use techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared.

Deployment: Deploy your model as a web application or API that can take inputs on various features of a house and predict its price.
